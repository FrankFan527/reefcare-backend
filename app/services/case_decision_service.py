# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Case decision policy (US5.4).
#
# SECURITY NOTE: recording a decision is a plain INSERT with no sanctioned
# database function behind it, so there is no ownership check in Postgres.
# As with request_more_information, load_owned_case below is the only thing
# preventing a coordinator from recording a decision on somebody else's case.
#
# This endpoint deliberately does not move the case status. The doc scopes
# save_case_decision to non-terminal fields, terminal moves belong to
# reefcare_close_report(), and mapping a response type onto a status
# transition is a decision the team has not made. intervention_required in
# particular has no corresponding status in case_status_transition.
