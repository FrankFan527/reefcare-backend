# Case workflow policy (US5.3, US5.4, US5.5).

# Services decide whether an action is allowed; repositories carry it out.
#
# SECURITY NOTE FOR REVIEWERS: reefcare_change_status() does not check that the
# actor owns the case. It takes p_actor_user_id but only records it in the
# audit event. So the ownership check below is not a convenience for producing
# a nicer error, it is the only thing preventing one coordinator from moving
# another coordinator's case. Compare reefcare_close_report(), which does check
# ownership in the database.
