# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Case decision persistence (US5.4).
#
# Repositories own SQL; services own workflow.
#
# NOTE: unlike closure, there is no sanctioned database function for recording
# a non-terminal decision. reefcare_close_report() writes a case_decision row
# as part of closing, but a decision recorded on its own is a plain INSERT.
# That means no database-level ownership check applies here either, and the
# service layer is again the only thing enforcing it.
#
# trg_case_decision_validate still fires on this INSERT and will reject a
# refer_or_share decision with no referred_to, and any Iteration 2 closure
# reason. Those remain authoritative regardless of what Python checked first.
